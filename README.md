# Duck Takeover - The Warehouse

You join a strange farmer, expecting peaceful days surrounded by nature. Instead, you find the ducks in a frenzy, piling up weapons in the barns. It seems the farmer had trained them or they running behind his back. Now, you must separate the farm tools from the weapons before the ducks declare war on the cows!

## OBJECTIVES 

🦆 Identify the items in the warehouse and separate the weapons from the farm tools.
🦆 Calculate the total revenue from selling the weapons based on their quantity and price.

###  SETUP

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone <repo_url>```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```cd <project_directory>```

3. Install dependencies:
  ```npm install```


### HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 

🦆 Create a function that processes an object representing the warehouse.

🦆 Return the total value of all the weapons in the warehouse.

🦆 Simple right? Don't let them have their way

#### FINAL RESULT 

🦆 Once you are ready to test your function just type in the terminal: 

```npm run test```

##### DEV'S STORY

This is part of a set of Katas developed by Team Subway Surfers. We wanted to create a fun challenge with a story of a farm being taken over by ducks and you, as a farmer, making sure they don't run amock.
